# Our School

Montebello High School, founded in 1909 in Montebello, California, is located in Los Angeles County, east of Downtown Los Angeles. The school's student body population is approximately 2,700 students. MHS's school mascot is Ollie the Oilers, making students' nicknames as Oilers. The Derrick Diary is the name for the school's newspaper, which is in reference to an oil derrick since Montebello was once a booming oil refinery town.
