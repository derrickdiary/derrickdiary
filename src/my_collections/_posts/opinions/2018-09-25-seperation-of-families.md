With the presidency of Donald Trump, there has been an increase in tension regarding immigration policies. It is widely acknowledged that President Trump dos not want immigrants in the Unites States. Policies against immigrants began after Trump prevented Muslims seeking refuge, from entering the country. President Trump’s intolerance for immigrants was even more evident after he shared his intentions to end DACA—an immigration policy that allows some individuals who were brought into the U.S. illegally as children to receive renewable deferred action from deportation.

Once again, President Trump’s opinion on immigration has led to controversy. Trump’s new administration policy of “zero tolerance” border enforcement will charge all immigrants who cross the border illegally with breaking the law. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has said that families who illegally cross the border may be separated after their arrest; children will be sent to juvenile shelters and parents will be sent to adult detention centers.

Although this policy is for people who cross the border illegally, it may apply to the people who have participated in the caravan that has recently been organized. This caravan consists of migrants from Central America, who have traveled through Mexico to the U.S. border. Although these people come to apply for asylum, there is a chance U.S. immigration authority could separate parents from their children upon their surrender at the border.

On the other hand, the Department of Health and Human Services says that they only take children into custody if parental relationships cannot be confirmed. This statement made by DHS has been refuted by Jennifer Podkul, director of policy of Kids in Need of Defense, a group that provides legal representation to unaccompanied children. Podkul has already noted cases involving two mothers who had their children taken away. The mothers of a 7-year old and a 12-year old were deported while their children were still under the custody of the U.S. immigration authorities. Podkul says that Trump’s administration is using these prosecutions in order to prevent more people from crossing the border. The statement made by Jennifer Podkul has been supported by Sessions himself through his statement that, “If you are smuggling a child, then we will be separated from you as required by law…” he then added, “If you don’t like that, then don’t smuggle children over our border.”

These migrants seek asylum from dangers they face in their home countries; yet, Trump’s administration has not made efforts to help these people in need for the sake of humanity. Instead, they raise fear among these families. Because the policies of Trump’s administration are overwhelming, lawyers cannot guarantee families will be kept together. In turn, there will be an increase in legal battles faced by federal courts.

It is baffling to be witnessing such heartlessness in the presidential administration. The types of actions and comments made towards people who seek asylum, by Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump, can only be explained by their lack of morals. These are families that want to a place to feel safe; they are not criminals. But Trump’s administration has made no efforts to protect or provide for the families in need of help, this all coming from the leader of what people across the world know as the “country of opportunity.”
