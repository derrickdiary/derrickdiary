How does it feel to not graduate on time? This is a situation no person should be in, but many seniors find themselves in this predicament, year after year. The semesters of missing credits add up and come senior year, these students may be running out of time to make them up. After polling several students, these are some words they must share on the possibility of not graduating on time with their peers.

“I feel nervous knowing that I might not graduate on time. It’s kind of embarrassing,” says one student whom has been officially notified that she is not be eligible to graduate. She admits her sadness because “you’re just watching your classmates graduate while you’re stilling working on it.” She can’t help but feel guilty for letting herself and her parents down.

Another student, “Jose,” on the other hand, does not really care much about it. He said he will get his GED, and it does not matter to him if he graduates on time. “Eddie” on the other hand confessed he feels depressed and mad at himself because he is not going to get to graduate with his friends. When asked their reasons for falling behind in credits, “Jennifer” blamed her laziness during her freshman year. At the time, she did not really care about her grades. Jose’s reasons were like hers, laziness along with ditching class a lot. Eddie blamed his lack of focus in class and talking too much when he should have been doing his work.

When the students were asked their families’ response to the possibility of their child not graduating on time, Eddie said that they still want him to graduate and to keep pushing himself. Jose’s family is mad and disappointed in him. Jennifer’s family still has hope for her, but she knows that they are nervous.

So, what are these students’ plans if they don't graduate in June? Jose’s plan is to attend summer school and online classes in the summer, and he will take the GED as well as adult school if needed. Jennifer’s plan is to keep pushing towards graduating on time. Just because there is the slightest chance that she will not graduate on time it does not mean she should put herself down. Eddie’s plan is to attend Futures because he knows that the teachers will not give up on him. His plan is to focus more and pass all his classes.

If these students could go back in time and do anything differently, there are many things they would change. Jose said he should have attended summer school earlier, so he would not be so much behind in credits. Jennifer wished she would have taken things seriously. Looking back, Jennifer sees just how easy high school is. Eddie’s responded he would focus on his schoolwork, stop talking, and passing all his class.  

For all the underclassmen, take some advice from these students. Jennifer encourages you to pass all your classes and to take school seriously. If you are failing classes, do everything you can now to fix it. Do not wait until the last minute, so you do not have to worry about graduating on time. Eddie’s advice students to get their priorities straight and focus on graduating. School will take you far in life. Being something in life is way better than being nothing in life. My advice is to focus on school and pass your classes, and if you are failing,  figure out how to fix it.  And, freshmen, grades do count.
