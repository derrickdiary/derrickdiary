Key Club International club is where members can serve their community alongside adults and make new friends. Key Club’s purpose is to give to those in need. At Key Club, officers find community events for its members to offer help to throughout the year. Each member’s community service hours are accounted for as well.

If interested, Key Club meets in Room F-12 during lunch every other Thursday. During meetings, members are handed an agenda listing current community events planned. However, students may be asked to provide their own transportation as only some events provide rides. To become a member, a student must complete an application and submit $12 dues, which go to the Kiwanis International organization.

Anyone interested in giving back to community and taking on leadership opportunities can join Key Club. This is also a great place to meet new people and make friends as you embark on beach clean-ups, distribute food to those in need, or raise funds for a good cause.
