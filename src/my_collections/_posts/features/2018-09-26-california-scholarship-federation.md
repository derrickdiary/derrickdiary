California Scholarship Federation (CSF) is a student club for students who have an academically strong grade point average and the goal to attend college. However, CSF is not just about promoting academics and college readiness.

Members of CSF also provide services to the school and to the community. These services include offering tutoring after school for all students on any subject, hosting a school-wide college fair in spring, and volunteering in community service events such as food drives, parades, etc. CSF is a club offered throughout many high schools in California, making it well known to universities. CSF requires you to apply every semester, so that your grades are maintained and calculated regularly. An “A” is worth three points and a “B” is worth one point. You need a total of ten points to meet the GPA standards for CSF.

CSF meets every other Friday in B-9 during lunch. For more information, see Ms. Endo.
