Photography is a form of expression and a stress reliever for many as well. Although this does not apply to every person, Photography Club serves as a place where students can express inner feelings or tell a story by capturing moments that mean something special through a camera lens.

Anyone who enjoys taking pictures of different subjects, for example nature or architecture should join the club. No picture is better than another, the purpose is for students to simply express themselves using their surroundings. The only requirement is to have a working camera so you can share your photos with the club. Everyone is very supportive and great feedback is always given. All the officers want members to not feel shy and express their true self with a single picture and tell the story behind why that certain picture was taken. At every meeting, a suggested topic is given. For example, water or shadows and the picture taken for the week will have to do with a certain topic. If someone wishes to share a photo not related to a given topic, he may also do that.

The Photography Club advisor is Mrs. Lozano and meetings are held every Wednesday in his room D-12. Attend a meeting and ask an officer for more information.
