The making a difference (M.A.D) club meets on every other Mondays during lunch in B-5. MAD club is a community service club that emphasizes spreading random acts of kindness to others. This includes creating kindness grams and handing them out to students at random.

Besides encouraging students to commit random acts of kindness on our campus, MAD club members sign up to volunteer to mentor and tutor students at Washington Elementary School after school on Fridays. The idea is that MAD club members can serve as role models for kindness to elementary students who in turn can share kindness with their peers. One of the clubâ€™s goals is to hold a kindness carnival every Friday in the month of February, kindness month, where they will be giving away small prizes to people who are spotted being kind to others.

This club is open to all who would like to help spread kindness inside and outside of our school.
