The AVID club can help a student with community service and it can be put on a college application. The AVID club focuses on a studentsâ€™ ability to work with others.This club can be joined by anyone who would like to participate in different events. If you are not in the AVID program, you could still join the club, it is open to everyone.

AVID club meets every other Monday in classroom F-8. The only requirement is anyone who joins should be responsible about showing up to events that they have signed up for. Usually, AVID meetings do not take the whole lunch time because they consist of event dates and sign ups. AVID club understands not all who join are outgoing. This is why different types of events are offered. As time progresses, they should be willing to sign up for an event that involve more socializing. The only pressure put on a student is that of showing up on time to events. AVID has movie nights where a movie is played and snacks are sold. AVID Play Day is a community service opportunity that also help students interact with other grades.

Although dates have yet to be confirmed, AVID club will be participating in the Mariachi 5K run and more events are yet to come.
