Mission Nutrition is a campus club that actually promotes healthy eating and encourages students to stay away from what is considered junk food. Unlike other clubs, the Mission Nutrition club actually feeds its members as part of the club’s purpose. What better way to learn about new foods than to try some personally? This is a great alternative for those who don’t like cafeteria food, who do not bring their own lunch, can’t afford to buy anything for lunch, and also for those who may have otherwise not eaten a lunch.

The Mission Nutrition meetings are held in Mrs. Martinez’s room in D-15 every Tuesday during lunch. There are no requirements to join this fantastic and educational club. Although since potlucks are usually held in the club, so everyone is expected pitches in something to eat at times. In the past, the club has also given out free samples of nutritious foods for non-members to try out, too.

If you are looking for healthier alternative foods to add to your life and meet like-minded students, check out Mission Nutrition.
