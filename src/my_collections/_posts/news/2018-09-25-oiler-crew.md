There is a new program at Montebello High School, Oiler Crew, that is designed to benefit freshmen. This program is new to MHS and Ms. Rego was happy to provide more information about it. She showed enthusiasm for the students who are part of the Oiler Crew and with the contribution and support of other teachers, this program will reach its full potential and make a great impact on the MHS campus.

Ms. Rego along with Ms. Martinez are heading up the Oiler Crew program with the desire to improve the experience of all freshmen, and hope that by extension, the rest of the MHS student body. The purpose of Oiler Crew is to help connect the incoming freshmen to MHS. The program hopes this will improve school culture as well as help freshmen transition to the realities of being in high school. Ms. Rego shared, “I used to teach freshman English and for a lot of students, intermediate school and high school are a lot different so coming here is a big shock to the system.” It is also well documented that freshmen overall grades as well as attendance and class behavior need improvement. The Oiler Crew hopes to help facilitate those improvements.

To be in the Oiler Crew, a student had to have been nominated by a teacher last spring. According to Ms. Rego, the program received over 95 student nominations from teachers. These students were then required to attend an event at the end of last year, then come to a training this past August prior to the beginning of school. For those interested in becoming an Oiler Crew leader for the upcoming year, current 10th and 11th graders will be able to apply in the month of February. Those who should apply are people who care about helping others, can attend trainings and most of the events, and has reasonable grades. This does not necessarily mean straight A’s and B’s, but not more than a couple of classes that they are struggling with currently.

Since the Oiler Crew is focused entirely on helping freshmen, especially those who are struggling with grades and attendance, the Oiler Crew is looking for students to be role models to these students.

Some may ask what are some specific requirements of the leaders in Oiler Crew? Since this is its first year of operation, the Oiler Crew leaders, were given some flexibility. “We asked that all our leaders participated in the Freshmen Orientation on August 24th and that as many as possible came to either the August 31st football game or the Freshmen Fair,” stated Ms. Rego.  Next year, the plan is to hold quarterly grade conferences with the freshmen to make sure they get any help they need.

The Oiler Crew program is still a work in progress, but it is the hope that it will become a class where freshmen can seek help/mentoring with schoolwork or school-related issues, including social issues. This is one of the ways Oiler Crew is set apart from MHS’s AMP program, which focuses only on academic mentoring.  Ms. Rego stated, “I hope to make Oiler Crew a big part of the school that works side by side with ASB and does regularly scheduled meetups, tutoring sessions, and activities.”
