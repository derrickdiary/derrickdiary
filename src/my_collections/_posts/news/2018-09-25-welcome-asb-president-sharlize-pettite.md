​It is time to welcome ASB President for the 2018-2019 school year, Miss Sharlize Pettite. Pettite is replacing graduating ASB President, Selina Duran, and is looking forward to her new tasks.

Pettite is very excited to lead the MHS student body and has many ideas to try. Running for office and especially ASB President can be stressful and challenging. But what motivated Pettite to run for president is her vision for how she can improve MHS by bringing about changes. For example, Pettite feels more can be done to recognize more students for the things they do. Pettite feels more people need to be given recognition, not just athletes, but students individually. This will spread some positivism around our campus. Also, Pettite shared there are changes she feels that need to be made within the student body to unite them better and encourage them to become the change they want to see in school. Pettite would also like to organize better school activities and work on increasing our overall school spirit.

Pettite has been involved with ASB since her eighth grade at La Merced Intermediate, where she was ASB President. She began her ASB career at MHS as a class representative. This shows she has many years of school leadership experience. Pettite plans to achieve her goals as president by spreading awareness about upcoming events ahead of time, so no one misses out, hosting better spirit days and pep rallies, and making sure that the student body’s voices are heard.

During Pettite’s free time, she enjoys reading books, watching movies, listening to music, and spending time with her friends. Aside from ASB, Pettite is also a varsity cheerleader. Pettite would like to thank and acknowledge her friends and family for pushing her to exceed her limitations. She admits she probably would not have been elected president without their support.
