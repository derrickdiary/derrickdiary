Ah yes, the time has come. There will be no more sleeping for several hours straight, no more binge watching on Netflix, and no more going to the beach. Get new clothes, pack your backpacks, and drink a bunch of coffee; it’s a necessity for a high school student… it’s back to school.

Freshmen, better be careful in the wild jungle that is high school. Good luck with having piles of homework and staying up almost every night to get them done, especially projects. Bring a map; it’s quite difficult to find classes since there are buildings everywhere. Do be careful when the bell rings, gigantic crowds form when that happens. A good tactic would be to grab your friend’s backpack strap like a dog on a leash to help you guide through the crowd. Sophomores you thought freshmen year was easy or difficult? Whether it was difficult or not, best of luck to all of you. School should not be taken so lightly. Freshmen year may have been a bit bumpy and somewhat simple but sophomore year is tough.

Juniors the spotlights are on you. Thousands of colleges are waiting to see what you are made of so make a move and apply to as many colleges as you like. Make them want you to attend their college. Shine bright and knock them dead! Seniors should do the same: this may be your last year but don’t waver under the senioritis’s gaze.

Fellow MHS students, remember to not procrastinate on your schoolwork because it will haunt and bite you. The due date may be far away but never relax until you have completed the assignment. Relaxing too much is not a good habit to have and should be fixed. Remember to use time management and prioritize yourself and push anything, such as social media, away from you. Those may be tempting but it is for the best. They are a bad distraction.
