​On September 11, 2018 in the MHS courtyard during lunch time, hundreds of students attended a memorial honoring the almost 3,000 innocent people whose lives ended too soon on September 11, 2001. Although students were not old enough to know what it was like to live the horrors of that day, their sadness for the families who lost loved ones could be felt around campus.

The lunch memorial at the courtyard was a chance for students to hear from people who recalled very personally what that September 11th day was like for them. After a greeting from President Sharlize Pettite, several people were asked to come up and speak to the audience. Among those who spoke were both Montebello Police and Montebello Fire captains, who each shared what they experienced that day and how it affects them today. These brave men were supported by several members of their units at the memorial. English teacher Mr. Ruiz shared a poem he wrote called “About that day,” which shared the struggles, from a teacher’s point of view, to answer students’ questions about the terror attacks and comfort them at the same time. The MHS Choir closed the memorial with a song fit for the occasion, “Imagine” by John Lennon.  

Nothing can erase or change the terrible things that happened that day, but we all can do our part and honor those whose lives ended each year and the families that were changed forever.
