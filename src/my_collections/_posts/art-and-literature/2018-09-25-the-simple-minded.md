They were different and mistreated
Different but beautiful
They were ignorant and unfair
Ignorant and racist
They caused conflict
They were humiliated
Judged by colors from ignorant ideas
Used as something and not as someone
Angry intentions caused problems
Mistreatment interrupted their tranquility
Issues of racism sting
Enough harsh treatment
Fury brings strength, trust me
