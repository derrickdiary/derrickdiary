You are a world away from mine,

With searing memories of love

That turn my heart to ashes

You have only given me hope

Of a better life after this madness

Of a future that holds out its hand

To me

A reflection of what could be but

Never is

For you are a daydream,

A beautiful distraction to feed

My imagination

To free me from chains that bind me

To loneliness
