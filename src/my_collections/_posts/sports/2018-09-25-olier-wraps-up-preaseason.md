The Oilers had a rough night on Thursday, September 13th at Cal High School against the La Serna Lancers. The Oilers were defeated 56-17 in their final preseason game, making their overall record 1-4. With a bye week before league season begins, the Oilers have time to regroup, learn from their experiences, and be ready to fight for their rightful place at the top of the Almont League.

La Serna, being undefeated this season (4-0) going into the game, the Oilers knew they were going to be challenged. The Lancers came out strong and dominated the first quarter, scoring touchdowns each they had possession of the ball, making the score 14-0 early on in the game. The Oilers’ defense struggled to put a stop to the Lancers’ offense. Their quarterback was hitting his receivers consistently throughout the second quarter as well. By halftime, La Serna was up 42-3, with Oilers’ only points coming from a field goal.

After halftime, the Oilers’ defense improved and was able to stop the Lancers’ passing this time, but they struggled to score on offense. The Oilers were able to advance the ball down the field, but not enough to get a score. It was not until fourth quarter that the Oilers were able to gain a touchdown. Soon after that first touchdown, the Oilers were able to score again on a short pass. Unfortunately, the Oilers ran out of time to catch up to the Lancers and were defeated with a final score of 56-17, marking an end to Montebello's preseason. 

Even though the Oilers did not come home with a victory that night, they must now focus on league season and prepare to face another Lancer team, Bell Gardens. This has been a tough match in the past for these two teams, and since it is MHS’s Homecoming game, it will definitely be an exciting game. Go Oilers!
